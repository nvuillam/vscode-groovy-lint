# CONTRIBUTE

Contributions are very welcome!

## Setup

To contribute first [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)

## Raise PR

Once your code is ready, documented and linted, raise a
[pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
with your changes [here](https://github.com/nvuillam/vscode-groovy-lint/pulls).
